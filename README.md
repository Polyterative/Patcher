# Patcher

This project was originally generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.2.3. Current is angular 13

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically
reload if you change any of the source files.

# Develop branch is where code gets advanced
production branch gets directly uploaded via automated tools. Beware

## ATTENTION
Be aware that currently there is no DEV environment. Any change made with the dev code running is working directly with the production database!!!
Be sure on what API calls you make.
